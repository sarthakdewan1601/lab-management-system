# Lab Management System


Built a Platform for the CS block of our college on Django using Html ,Css , Bootstrap and SQLite3 as Database.
<br>
This website will help the staff and officials to manage all the electronic devices as well as the furniture in the labs and all other offices in the building.The user can log in a complaint for any of these devices if they become faulty.The Technicians will be informed about these complaints simultaneously. 
<br>
As soon as the device is functioning again,the technician can remove the complaint and the device will be marked working again. Each lab is alloted to a particular lab attendant. This website also has a Leave Management System that keep a record of the employees and their leaves . Every Employee is alloted leaves equally as decided by the management.He can add a request for a leave and a substitute who will have to work in his absense.The Lab Supervisor will then accept his request or decline it accrodingly.Also we have provided for all the labs with their respective timetables and all the academic staff and Lab Attendants can access it.
